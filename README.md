*This game was assigned and created with the intentions of learning inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.*

### About the Game:

> Plantopia is an adventure game where the player has to complete trivia questions to earn coins.
> From there, the player is to earn enough coins to unlock the plant shop and purchase plants.
> The goal is to achieve four plants to win the game. 



# Explorable Areas Practice

## About the Assignment: 

> This was a direct practice and example from my Explorable Areas group practice assignment.
> The end goal was to work on a program that allowed the player to enter several different areas
> and collect items. I struggled with this one a bit due to the actual item mechanism.
> I managed to work through it a little by breaking down what was already given to me,
> in this case an item, and figured out how to reference and use the item in each application and task.
> I would say this is one of my most challenging assignments.

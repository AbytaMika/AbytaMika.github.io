***Welcome to Mikaela's GitHub Portfolio!***

*Hello!* Thank you for visiting my portfolio. My name is Mikaela and I am currently a student studying Game Art.

# What is this for?

> This portfolio is for my PROG 101 class and any examples I need to show in the near future. Projects from this portfolio
> will demonstrate what I have learned in the ~3 months I have had Visual Studio and C#!


### Enjoy!


# Midterm Project: Adventure Game
## Project Name: Plantopia

![Plantopia Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f3bc11d-734c-41be-a475-8612cc9adc30)

*This game was assigned and created with the intentions of learning inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.*

### About the Game:

> Plantopia is an adventure game where the player has to complete trivia questions to earn coins.
> From there, the player is to earn enough coins to unlock the plant shop and purchase plants.
> The goal is to achieve four plants to win the game.

# Explorable Areas Practice

![ExplorableAreasPractice](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f6a4202-fd9d-417e-b319-e589add56dd3)

### About the Assignment: 

> This was a direct practice and example from my Explorable Areas group practice assignment.
> The end goal was to work on a program that allowed the player to enter several different areas
> and collect items. I struggled with this one a bit due to the actual item mechanism.
> I managed to work through it a little by breaking down what was already given to me,
> in this case an item, and figured out how to reference and use the item in each application and task.
> I would say this is one of my most challenging assignments.


# 12 Days of Christmas Song Practice

![Abeyta12DaysOfChristmasExample](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fec93b9-ed86-4b49-8058-04c51955d54d)

### About the Assignment:

> This assignment was created with the goal to understand loops and conditional statements.
> For this assignment, my group chose the song 12 Days of Christmas.
> I learned how to effectively use if and else if statements and understood the concept of
> conditional statements.

### Credits:

> The code shown was in collaboration with classmates Jonah Watwood, Windy Vang, Natalija Plavsich,
> and Ava Cavanaugh. I had so much fun messing with this task!

# Shop Assginment

![AbeytaShopExample](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dbe7e85-7013-494b-b9c8-a9767595bfc9)

### About the Assignment:

> In this assignment, we were given the task to create a "shop." We used operators and conditional statements.
> We also implemented the conversion to US currency at the end. We used 2 classes: Store and Items. 

# Decoding Assignment

![AbeytaDecodingPractice](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/365c5a22-4a41-45d0-a6a7-43cf4b9b4071)

### About the Assignment:

> This practice created an application to encode and decode using a substitution cipher.
> I used a string for the alphabet in its correct form. After that, I shifted the letters
> in a new list to create the "scrambled" list.

### Challenges:
> Using a Caesar Cipher during this practice was a little challenging to me. It was
> particularly easy to just create the two lists then add code to display each.
